# Meal Master Mind



## Structure:


### Microservices Breakdown:

####     Recipe Service (FastAPI)
        Responsibilities: Handle all operations related to recipes such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes.
        Features:
            User authentication and authorization for recipe management (JWT-based).
            Endpoints to add new recipes, get recipes by ID, list all recipes, and update/delete recipes.
            Support for tagging recipes with dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
            Allow users to upload images and ingredients.

####    Meal Planning Service (Golang)
        Responsibilities: Manage the meal planning feature, allowing users to create meal plans based on recipes.
        Features:
            Create, retrieve, update, and delete meal plans.
            Generate meal plans based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and selected recipes.
            Allow users to customize meal plans with meals for specific days.

####    User Service (FastAPI)
        Responsibilities: Manage user accounts and profiles.
        Features:
            User registration, login, and profile management.
            User preferences for dietary restrictions and favorite recipes.
            Integration with third-party authentication (e.g., OAuth with Google/Facebook).

####    Shopping List Service (Golang)
        Responsibilities: Generate shopping lists based on selected recipes or meal plans.
        Features:
            Create a shopping list from selected recipes.
            Allow users to manage and edit their shopping lists.
            Suggest recipes based on ingredients users already have.

####    Notification Service (FastAPI)
        Responsibilities: Send notifications to users about meal planning reminders, recipe suggestions, etc.
        Features:
            Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) to communicate with other services.
            Send push notifications or emails to users regarding their meal plans.

### Architecture:

    API Gateway: Use an API Gateway (like Kong or Traefik) to route requests to the appropriate microservice based on the endpoint.
    Database: Use a shared database like PostgreSQL for persistent storage, or have separate databases for each service depending on requirements.
    Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the microservices for easier deployment and management.

### Additional Features:

    Include a search functionality to find recipes based on ingredients, tags, or popularity.
    Allow users to rate and comment on recipes.

### Technologies Used:

    FastAPI: For fast and efficient API development.
    Golang: For high-performance services (especially the Meal Planning and Shopping List services).
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Docker: For containerization of microservices.
    Message Queue: RabbitMQ or Kafka for communication between services (if needed).
